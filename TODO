- move the symbol table into an XML configuration file. This would make it 
  very easy to add new symbols without recompiling. It would also enable 
  people to distribute Vendor Specific-enabled configuration files

  and thus break compatibility ... -- ON HOLD (keep it simple, stupid). 
- Make loading of SNMP modules configurable (using "-m" switch instead of loading 
  everything under the sun)
